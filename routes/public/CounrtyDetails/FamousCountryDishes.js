output :     
Koshari: Koshari is often considered Egypt's national dish.
 It consists of a mix of pasta, rice, lentils, chickpeas,
  and crispy fried onions, topped with a spicy tomato sauce.
   It's a hearty and flavorful vegetarian dish.///Ful Medames:
    Ful Medames is a traditional Egyptian breakfast dish made 
    from fava beans cooked slowly and typically served with olive
     oil, garlic, lemon juice, and various toppings like onions, 
     tomatoes, and herbs.///Molokhia: Molokhia is a green leafy 
     vegetable often prepared as a soup or stew. It is usually
      cooked with garlic, coriander, and chicken or rabbit. It has
       a distinct, somewhat slimy texture and is usually served with
        Egyptian bread or rice.///Shawarma: While shawarma 
        is a Middle Eastern dish, it's incredibly popular 
        in Egypt. Thinly sliced marinated meat 
        (usually beef, chicken, or lamb) is cooked 
        on a vertical rotisserie and served in 
        pita bread with tahini, vegetables, and 
        various condiments./// Ta'meya (Egyptian Falafel):
         Ta'meya is Egypt's version of falafel. It's made 
         from crushed fava beans or a mixture of fava beans
          and chickpeas, mixed with herbs and spices, then 
          deep-fried to create crispy, flavorful patties. 
          It's typically served in pita bread or as a 
          snack.///Moussaka: Egyptian moussaka is quite
           different from the Greek version. It's a 
           layered casserole dish made with layers 
           of eggplant, minced meat (often beef or lamb), 
           tomatoes, and bÃ©chamel sauce, similar 
           to lasagna.///Hawawshi: Hawawshi is a 
           popular Egyptian street food. It's 
           essentially a stuffed pita or flatbread 
           filled with seasoned minced meat 
           (typically beef or lamb) mixed with 
           spices, onions, and sometimes hot
            peppers, then baked or grilled.///Roz Bel 
            Laban: Roz Bel Laban is a traditional 
            Egyptian rice pudding made with rice, 
            milk, sugar, and flavored with vanilla 
            and sometimes topped with ground cinnamon 
            or nuts. It's a popular dessert.///Baklava: 
            Baklava, though of Turkish origin, is widely
             enjoyed in Egypt. It's a sweet pastry made 
             of layers of filo dough filled with chopped 
             nuts and sweetened with syrup or
              honey.///Fattah: Fattah is a festive 
              dish often served during special occasions.
               It typically consists of layers of toasted
                or fried bread, rice, and lamb or beef
                , all soaked in a flavorful tomato or 
                vinegar-based sauce and garnished with
                 garlic and crispy fried onions.///
